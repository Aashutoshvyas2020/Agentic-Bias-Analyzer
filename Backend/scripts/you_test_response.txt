Minnesota's Democratic leaders and the administration of President Donald Trump, a Republican, have offered [starkly different accounts](https://www.reuters.com/graphics/USA-TRUMP/MINNESOTA-RECONSTRUCT/egvbbeqeevq/) of the incident.\n\nRead about innovative ideas and the people working on solutions to global crises with the Reuters Beacon newsletter.

The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, has maintained that the agent acted in self-defense because Good, a volunteer in a community network that monitors and records ICE operations in Minneapolis, drove forward in the direction of the agent who then shot her, after another agent had approached the driver's side and told her to get out of the car.\n\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\n\nThe shooting on Wednesday came soon after some 2,000 federal officers were dispatched to the Minneapolis-St. Paul area in what DHS has called its largest operation ever, deepening a rift between the administration and Democratic leaders in the state.\n\nFederal-state tensions escalated further on Thursday when a U.S. Border Patrol agent in Portland, Oregon, [shot and wounded](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/ice-fatal-shooting-minnesota-woman-puts-us-edge-2026-01-08/) a man and woman in their car after an attempted vehicle stop. Using language similar to its description of the Minneapolis incident, DHS said the driver had tried to \"weaponize\" his vehicle and run over agents.\n\nThe two DHS-related shootings prompted a coalition of progressive and civil rights groups, including Indivisible and the American Civil Liberties Union, to plan more than 1,000 events under the banner \"ICE Out For Good\" on Saturday and Sunday. The rallies have been scheduled to end before nightfall to minimize the potential for violence.\n\nIn Philadelphia, protesters chanted \"ICE has got to go\" and \"No fascist USA,\" as they marched from City Hall to a rally outside a federal detention facility, according to the local ABC affiliate. In Manhattan, several hundred people carried anti-ICE signs as they walked past an immigration court where agents have arrested migrants following their hearings.\n\n\"We demand justice for Renee, ICE out of our communities, and action from our elected leaders. Enough is enough,\" said Leah Greenberg, co-executive director of Indivisible.\n\n![Immigration enforcement action continues, days after the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good by an ICE agent, in Minneapolis](https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VY4I7DCB2RIG5KTE76KI33C4X4.jpg?auth=17430c859cb471d91945d42b4fc4af0f15b646a4eeb566be64db1528bb718f5d&width=1080&quality=80)\n\n![Immigration enforcement action continues, days after the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good by an ICE agent, in Minneapolis](https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/2K6QL7GSMJI35LWJCEVYLSPEME.jpg?auth=6a93b1675e663b61027109d67dfcb56823ce4aa3fbeeb2156c3b38cf6d43fbee&width=1080&quality=80)\n\n![Immigration enforcement action continues, days after the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good by an ICE agent, in Minneapolis](https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WZH7YPYCNFMHZJZSSBPBPFFVAE.jpg?auth=f1e559b2324642d621d7e2058d3cd2dbc5ce0821b5113b9e0edf67d6f14312a1&width=1080&quality=80)\n\n![Immigration enforcement action continues, days after the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good by an ICE agent, in Minneapolis](https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RHK3HW2K6NMLFHZV2TNE3KDN7E.jpg?auth=6174a596a5883f70125593501a6941466039856490658f685108489538c47c35&width=1080&quality=80)\n\n![People protest against increased immigration enforcement after the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent, in Minneapolis](https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VX5SSPBHRVNYVMLK6IJ4AH4C3E.jpg?auth=0959e3c6f374e6f1f4f0c51ab8a46cada74946c48205d9c5c497c83f8c3a6c53&width=1080&quality=80)\n\n![Immigration enforcement action continues, days after the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good by an ICE agent, in Minneapolis](https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/AUE3WMUNH5KULOJ7V2OQNHX2MQ.jpg?auth=82ac2a9ba3125c927b4c931e0c3156860e15f798be72f2c27778b47b3d6c8aff&width=1080&quality=80)\n\n![Immigration enforcement action continues, days after the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good by an ICE agent, in Minneapolis](https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/V6LKPE5KGNPDLJTQ3WHK2TCYDQ.jpg?auth=efb0b73f18fccef6c711e851089d3966febe92e35ec9987cc8032e03de2d8c35&width=1080&quality=80)\n\n![Demonstration against increased immigration enforcement, days after the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good by an ICE agent, in Minneapolis](https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4YYF2OEDLNLPFO3TRZRDHJUDRQ.jpg?auth=0a0059a15eb4f718e1f646eac530076279e56cb0efce2bfadef1fea4ecce2c61&width=1080&quality=80)\n\n![Scene of the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good by an ICE agent, in Minneapolis](https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EJDEHJWKXVIZJIHZROFL5J73U4.jpg?auth=1fb65cb3cccce1956ba70fa615a7ba1d17b6f62acf9ae7818e0f6fd922f2fa29&width=1080&quality=80)\n\nItem 9 of 9 A message and flowers lie at the makeshift memorial at the scene of the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, U.S., January 8, 2026.

Legislators called the denial illegal.\n\n\"We made it clear to ICE and DHS that they were violating federal law,\" U.S. Representative Angie Craig told reporters as she stood outside the Whipple Federal Building in St. Paul with Representatives Kelly Morrison and Ilhan Omar.\n\nFederal law prohibits DHS from blocking members of Congress from entering ICE detention sites, but DHS has increasingly restricted such oversight visits, prompting confrontations with Democratic lawmakers.\n\n\"It is our job as members of Congress to make sure those detained are treated with humanity, because we are the damn United States of America,\" Craig said.\n\nReferencing the damage and protests at Minneapolis hotels overnight, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the congressional Democrats were denied entry to ensure \"the safety of detainees and staff, and in compliance with the agency's mandate.\" She said DHS policies require members of Congress to notify ICE at least seven days in advance of facility visits.\n\nReporting by Renee Hickman and Maria Cardona in Minneapolis, Carlos Barria in Portland, Ryan Jones in Toronto and Nathan Layne in Wilton, Connecticut; Writing

The case will now be investigated exclusively by the FBI.\n- The killing and the [influx of ICE agents](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/minneapolis-federal-agents-crackdown/) in the city has led to several protests over the last few days.

It has changed the shape of our work day as we've put new protocols in place to try and keep everyone safe,\" said Chris Erickson, president of the St. Cloud Education Association.\n\nErickson said his educators are preparing to find alternate ways to hold parent-teacher conferences.\n\n\"Many parents do not feel safe coming to our schools because of the fear of being taken away from their schools, their homes and their workplaces. I had a special education teacher who works with students with physical and cognitive disabilities, and she shared with me that one of her students stated in a message to her, 'I'm afraid to go to school,'\" Erickson said. \"Public education is a right, and every child in Minnesota deserves to attend a public school that is safe and welcoming — but that cannot happen as long as ICE remains in Minnesota. They need to leave our state and they need to leave our schools now.\"\n\nWendy Marczak, president of the Bloomington Federation of Teachers, said federal agents are \"terrorizing families\" in her schools.\n\n\"We train for school shootings. We do not train for our own federal government to terrorize children. Ask yourself, would you want your child going through this?
